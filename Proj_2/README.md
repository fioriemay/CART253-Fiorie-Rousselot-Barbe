For my final project, I created a game titled LoveStruck. I wanted to create a fun 2D top-view shooter game set in a minimalistic universe, where the main goal
is for the player to shoot as many evil stars as possible.

Game rules:
- You must shoot the stars using the pink crosshairs.
- Any star that gets past you will not respawn, but any one you do shoot down will. This makes it more difficult to pass your high-score. It's a little bit like juggling, if you want a very high score you need to keep the stars from passing you.
- You can see your score in the top-left corner of the screen. Once the stars stop spawning, you can see your final score. Refresh the page to try to beat it!

I really loved the idea of a simple yet flashy black & pink color palette, and inspired myself from old arcade games to create the game's aesthetic.

Everything you see has been hand-drawn and animated. I created the title screen from scratch and animated it myself, and every game asset (including the cursor) I have drawn myself.
I was limited by the quality of gifs, so if you wish to view the animations (title screen and game background) in HD, they are in my GitHub repository under 'assets'.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
